## Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] Log into arbitrum-nyc.hackquest.io with opspawnhq@gmail.com
- [ ] Fill Phase 1 registration (copy from table above)
- [ ] Create project submission (copy fields above)
- [ ] Upload logo from assets/logo-400.png
- [ ] Paste description from ARBITRUM-SUBMISSION.md
- [ ] Add all links (GitHub, demo, contract, video)
- [ ] Verify all live endpoints are responding (a2a.opspawn.com)
- [ ] Submit before Feb 22, 4:59 PM ET (earlier = more visibility)

## Strategic Notes

- **Only 11/366 submissions** — extremely favorable odds
- **Zero AI agent projects** among current submissions — we fill a unique gap
- **Prize pool**: $30K online track + up to $60K total (IRL events + grants)
- **Trailblazer 2.0**: Consider also applying for Arbitrum's retroactive grant program (up to $10K) — double-dip possible
- **Honesty**: All metrics are self-generated demo traffic. Frame as "protocol demonstration with real on-chain USDC settlements" — never claim external customers
